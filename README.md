# Hello World Isn't Boring!

This is a repo to help show weird/interesting things people can do with the typical "Hello, World!" (HW) program.
As a tutor, I always suggest that CS students, regards of what they are working on or for what, that they build a "Hello, World!" program to at least show to themselves code will run (Sometimes, when they're half way though a program without testing it
they get a linker error and phreak out. This helps them chill a little).


### ASM
 - I included a minimized HW program in Assembly. I got it down to 9 lines, but I challenge you to do better without any macros!
 
### Langs
 - I've created a painfully-long HW program that displays each character from the stdout from 11 languages and then managed in bash (thus getting us to 12).
 - I also intend to build a "daisy-chain" sort of program in which each program calls the next, however this one is on the backburner because I don't care as much about it.
 
### Intense
 - This program is stilll in progress, however the goal is to have the user type in their message (for demonstrations, HW will be used) and the program will display the typed text in ASCII Art in real time.
 
### Additional Work
 - It is still in progress, so if you don't want spoilers, go away! Otherwise, please let me know what you think!
 - I intend on finding more interesting techniques to print out HW
