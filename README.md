# Hello World Isn't Boring!

This is a repo to help show weird/interesting things people can do with the typical "Hello, World!" (HW) program.
As a tutor, I always suggest that CS students, regardless of what they are working on or who for, build a "Hello, World!" program to show to themselves that code will run (Sometimes, when they're half way though a program without testing it
they get a linker error and phreak out. This helps them chill a little).
Additionally, this is a good platform to introduce multiple ideas to newer students such as Assembly, Bash Scripting (and how lots of coding languages are pretty similar when you get down to the brass `syn`tax), User-Interface (por v√≠a `colors`), and "Being Absurd" (seen in `intense`). 


### ASM
 - I included a minimized HW program in Assembly. I got it down to 9 lines, but I challenge you to do better __without any macros!__
 
### Langs
 - I've created a painfully-long HW program that displays each character from the stdout from 11 languages and then managed in bash (thus getting us to 12).
 - I also intend to build a "daisy-chain" sort of program in which each program calls the next, however this one is on the backburner.
 
### Colors
 - This version of Hello, World! will output with select color schemes chosen by the user. This was motivated by Karl Castleton's assignment to print `Hello, World!` with colors behind it, which is the default setting for the program.
 - More colors can be added to the program, however I am only mortal and as such have both limited time and focus. Feel free to go overboard with it!
 
### Intense
 - This program is still in progress, however the goal is to have the user type in their message (for demonstrations, HW will be used) and the program will display the ASCII Art of the text in real time.
 
### Additional Work
 - It is still in progress, so if you don't want spoilers, go away! Otherwise, please let me know what you think!
 - I intend on finding more interesting techniques to print out HW
 - This project was made with the intention of helping others learn. If you have any questions, feel free to let me know. Feel free to share the project with others, copy it, whatever. Make sure you learn, though.
